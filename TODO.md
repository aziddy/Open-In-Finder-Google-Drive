#### Option C: Use Terminal/Command Line

- [ ] Create alias in shell profile: `alias openinfinder='/Applications/OpenInFinder.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenInFinder'`

### 3. For Google Drive Integration

### 4. Advanced Solutions (If Needed)

#### Option A: Code Signing
- [ ] Get Apple Developer Account ($99/year)

- [ ] Sign the app with: `codesign --deep --force --verify --verbose --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name" OpenInFinder.app`
- [ ] Test if signed app appears in context menus

#### Option B: Notarization
- [ ] After signing, notarize the app with Apple

#### If Finder Doesn't Open
- [ ] Test `open -R` command directly: `open -R /path/to/file`
